Travel Planner AI Agent ֎🇦🇮

Smart AI-Powered Trip Planner using IBM Watsonx


---

Introduction

The Travel Planner Agent is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to make travel planning effortless and personalized. Built using IBM Watsonx.ai and Granite Foundation Models, it understands natural language queries to create custom travel itineraries, suggest destinations, recommend accommodations and transport options, and adjust plans dynamically based on live weather, traffic, and event data.

Whether you're a solo traveler, business professional, or student attending an academic event, this assistant ensures your trip is smooth, optimized, and enjoyable. Integrated with IBM Cloud services, it delivers a responsive, multilingual, and smart travel experience — right from planning to execution.
